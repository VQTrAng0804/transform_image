## Thanks
    The CS50X course provided me with exceptional knowledge about computers and their workings. It helped me progress from a complete beginner to a skilled programmer. Thanks to the dedication of Mr. David Malan, Mr. Brian, Mr. Doug Lloyd, and all the CS50X mentors, I'm now able to create projects I never thought possible before. I am deeply grateful for your support!
